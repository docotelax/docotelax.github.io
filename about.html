      <p>
        <strong>Docotela X</strong> is not just a clothing label — it's an immersive journey through freedom, art, and individuality.
        Each piece is handcrafted as a symbol of liberation from convention, telling stories through texture, form, and raw creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded on the philosophy that <em>freedom is the highest form of luxury</em>, Docotela X is a statement for those who dare to live artfully, unapologetically, and with intent.
        Every collection is limited — not for exclusivity's sake, but to preserve the emotional intimacy between the artist and the wearer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vision is bold: to redefine fashion as experience, to blur the lines between gallery and wardrobe, and to champion creators whose work speaks louder than trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docotela X was born in Johannesburg, but its language is global — rooted in struggle, rebirth, self-expression, and the relentless pursuit of authenticity.
